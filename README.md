Clear instructions for how to REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call. 

In order to request data, have a program write “go” into the “starterfile.txt” which will begin the microservice’s true purpose and request that a stock token is given via the console. The microservice will then take the users input and insert it into the file “transferfile.txt” which can be extracted by a different service. 

Clear instructions for how to RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented 

To receive the data from the microservice, take the token that is inserted into the first line of the “transferfile.txt” which will be the stock token that the user inputs. 

UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data work. Make it detailed enough that your partner (and your grader) will understand
